# Dynamic3D: Real-Time Simulation and Analysis for 3D Scholarly Editions

Dynamic3D seeks to transform how we interact with and understand 3D models in the humanities and social sciences.
By enhancing the Smithsonian's Voyager platform, it will introduce tools for real-time simulations, exploring variables
and hypotheses, and visualising uncertainties. This initiative will enable researchers to delve deeper into the dynamic
aspects of cultural heritage, making 3D visualisations not just visually appealing but also analytically powerful and
trustworthy. Through three distinct use cases—analysing a historic battle, exploring early modern domestic interiors, and
simulating early 20th-century home cinema technologies—Dynamic3D will demonstrate its potential to unlock new
interpretations and understandings of historical events and spaces. By making these tools available on an open-source
basis, the project aims to benefit the global research community, fostering innovation and collaboration in 3D
scholarship.
